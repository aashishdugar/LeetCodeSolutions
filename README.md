# LeetCodeSolutions
A compilation of all Java/Python solutions to all the LeetCode problems I have personally solved. These solution were optimal or near optimal(i.e in the upper 95% of the solutions) at the time of solving. However as solutions improve and evolve, plus the run-time is dependent on the the freedom of the server w.r.t requests to compile, the result may not quite be the same for you. Not much variation however!

I just thought it would be a great way to see all the solutions at once if a question is in your mind and you dont want to access the site constantly. Just a simple consolidation of them.
As said above, these are personally solved, so while I haven't solved all the LeetCode questions, I'll keep updating this as I finish more.

* Link - https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/

The format of the solutions file in the directory is - 
*    <i>/LeetCodeSolutions/{Problem Number} - {Name of Problem}(difficulty) - {language of solution}</i>

The solutions here, once the question is read, are quite simple and self explanatory so I haven't included comments in most of the code.

#### Statistics - 
* <i>Solved</i> - 156/1028 (varies as I'm solving it in 2-3 Programming Languages)
* <i>Time Spent on LeetCode</i> - 132 hours (+18 hours since last update)
* <i>Acceptance Rate on LeetCode</i>- 51.7% (-2% since last update)
* <i>Last Updated Repo</i> - 10th Jan 2021

{<b>NOTE</b> - This repo is always evolving, so if there any improvements to the run-time/any comments to clarify something/any mistakes, do let me know and I'll be happy to make the changes!}
